# Sencillo

Sencillo is a collection of simple baseline schedulers designed for use in Kubernetes-based edge computing environments. These schedulers aim to provide straightforward scheduling algorithms that can be used as benchmarks or starting points for more complex scheduling solutions.

## Features
## Features


- ðŸš€ **Baseline Scheduling Algorithms**: Implements essential and efficient scheduling strategies ideal for edge computing.
- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/master/logo/logo.png" alt="Kubernetes" width="20"/> **Kubernetes Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes clusters for smooth deployment and management.
- ðŸ§© **Modular Architecture**: Easily extend and customize scheduling logic thanks to a clean and modular codebase.

## Repository Structure

- `cmd/`: Contains the main entry points for the different scheduler implementations.
- `configs/`: Configuration files for the schedulers.
- `deployments/`: Kubernetes deployment manifests for deploying the schedulers.
- `internal/`: Internal packages and modules used across the project.
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building the scheduler container images.
- `Makefile`: Makefile for automating build and deployment tasks.
- `docker-compose.yaml`: Docker Compose configuration for local development and testing.
- `go.mod` and `go.sum`: Go module files for dependency management.
- `main.go`: The main entry point for the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.16 or higher
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) cluster

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Noisyboy-9/sencillo.git
   cd sencillo
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:

   ```bash
   make docker-build
   ```

3. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:

   Ensure your `kubectl` is configured to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster, then run:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployments/
   ```

## Usage

After deployment, the schedulers will be running within your Kubernetes cluster, ready to handle scheduling tasks based on their implemented algorithms. You can monitor their behavior and performance using Kubernetes tools and logs.
